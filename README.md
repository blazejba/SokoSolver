# SokoSolvers - Sokoban game solvers
A hobby project to get a feel for different programming paradigms with different programming languages. The goal is to (1) implement a puzzle game called Sokoban, in Japanease "warehouse keeper", (2) find the optimal solution using different tree search techniques, both traditional and machine learning enhencements, and (3) benchmark the performance of implementations in Python, C++, Rust and Golang.
